You are given a list of elements, including possible null values, to create a Binary Search Tree (BST). 

Input:
1. Number of elements (N): An integer representing the total number of elements
2. Elements: A list of integers

Output:
Print the in-order traversal of the constructed BST, omitting the `null` values.

Example:

Input:
Number of elements: 5
Elements: 50, 30, 20, 40, 70

Output:
In-order Traversal: 20, 30, 40, 50, 70

Explanation:
The constructed BST is:
       50
      /  \
    30   70
   /  \
 20   40

Hence, the "in-order" traversal is => 20, 30, 40, 50, 70
